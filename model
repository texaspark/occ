There are eight classes in model package of Dropwizard application. DimensionGroupEntity, DimemsionNameValueEntity, EntityConstants, MetricPropertyEntity, ServiceEntity, SummarizedComputeMetricDataEntity, SummarizedExaDataMetricDataEntity, SummarizedStorageMetricDataEntity. 

It seems like the model package of the Dropwizard application contains eight classes related to computing and storing metric data:

DimensionGroupEntity - This class represents a dimension group, which is a set of related dimensions that can be used to group metrics.

DimensionNameValueEntity - This class represents a single dimension name and value pair.

EntityConstants - This class defines constants used throughout the model package.

MetricPropertyEntity - This class represents a property of a metric, such as its name, description, or unit.

ServiceEntity - This class represents a service that generates metric data.

SummarizedComputeMetricDataEntity - This class represents summarized compute metric data, which includes metrics related to computing performance.

SummarizedExaDataMetricDataEntity - This class represents summarized Exadata metric data, which includes metrics related to Exadata performance.

SummarizedStorageMetricDataEntity - This class represents summarized storage metric data, which includes metrics related to storage performance.

These classes provide a structured way of storing and manipulating metric data within the Dropwizard application.
