In model package: DimensionGroupEntity, DimemsionNameValueEntity, EntityConstants, MetricPropertyEntity, ServiceEntity, SummarizedComputeMetricDataEntity, SummarizedExaDataMetricDataEntity, SummarizedStorageMetricDataEntity. 

It contains eight classes related to computing and storing metric data:

- DimensionGroupEntity - This class represents a dimension group, which is a set of related dimensions that can be used to group metrics.

- DimensionNameValueEntity - This class represents a single dimension name and value pair.

- EntityConstants - This class defines constants used throughout the model package.

- MetricPropertyEntity - This class represents a property of a metric, such as its name, description, or unit.

- ServiceEntity - This class represents a service that generates metric data.

- SummarizedComputeMetricDataEntity - This class represents summarized compute metric data, which includes metrics related to computing performance.

- SummarizedExaDataMetricDataEntity - This class represents summarized Exadata metric data, which includes metrics related to Exadata performance.

- SummarizedStorageMetricDataEntity - This class represents summarized storage metric data, which includes metrics related to storage performance.

These classes provide a structured way of storing and manipulating metric data within the Dropwizard application.
